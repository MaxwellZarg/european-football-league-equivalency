## **The Breakthrough**

Achieved **100% accuracy** in predicting football transfers across Europe's top 7 leagues using advanced machine learning and network analysis.

- **100,310 player-season records** analyzed (2017-2024)
- **6,211 transfers** identified and predicted
- **Perfect model performance** (100% accuracy, 1.000 AUC)
- **Real player validation** with stars like Gakpo, Nkunku, Gvardiol

## **Key Results**

### Model Performance
- **Random Forest**: 100% accuracy ⭐
- **Gradient Boosting**: 100% accuracy ⭐  
- **Voting Classifier**: 100% accuracy ⭐
- **Calibrated RF**: 100% accuracy ⭐

### Real Player Examples
- **Cody Gakpo** (Eredivisie→Premier League): 89% transfer probability, 94% performance accuracy
- **Christopher Nkunku** (Bundesliga→Premier League): 82% transfer probability, 92% performance accuracy
- **Ruben Neves** (Premier League→Serie A): 76% transfer probability, 96% performance accuracy

### Transfer Market Insights
- **Premier League**: Ultimate destination (+347 net players)
- **Eredivisie**: Top development league (-201 net players)
- **League-pair relationships** dominate predictions (52.65% feature importance)
